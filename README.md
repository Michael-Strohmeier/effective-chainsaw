TLDR - GENKI-KANJI-VOCAB.csv contains ordered vocabulary containing kanji you are “taught” to write in Genki textbook series (reading section).

## Motivation
Learn kanji with vocabulary that is seen at some point in the book. I don’t like learning words that contain two new kanji at once. This list solves that problem.

## Thoughts
If using anki probably a good idea to do EN -> JP where you handwrite the JP word. Also worth considering JP -> EN where you only recognize the JP word. Do what you want it's your world.

## Disclaimer
- I don’t own any of the material / data.
- There is possibly a better vocabulary list in existence. This is merely how Genki ordered the kanji in their reading section - and I liked it.
- There are some issues like 十 being listed as とお which is sort of true but the word would be 十日・１０日 this should rarely happen thoughout the list. This was fixed but I haven't gone through the entire list - could be more.

## Missing Words/Kanji
Aside from lesson 23, there were 5 kanji skipped. This is because the compound words / words disagree with me.
-Lesson | Kanji
-5  田
-16	室
-19	不
-21	経
-22	回
-23  Half of lesson 23 is also missing.
