TLDR - final_kanji_vocab_set.csv contains ordered vocabulary containing kanji you are “taught” to write in Genki textbook series.

## Motivation
Learn kanji with vocabulary that is seen at some point in the book. I don’t like learning words that contain two new kanji at once. This list solves that problem.

## Thoughts
If using anki probably a good idea to do EN -> JP where you handwrite the JP word. Also worth considering JP -> EN where you only recognize the JP word. Do what you want it's your world.

## Disclaimer
- I don’t own any of the material / data.
- There is possibly a better vocabulary list in existence.
- There are some issues like 十 being listed as とお which is sort of true but the word would be 十日・１０日 this should rarely happen thoughout the list.
